# Etch-a-sketch
this is my pseudocode file igs so Im jsut going to wing it 
make a e- sketcth drawing game
it will be made of a 600px by 600px of squares that are adjustable by a button prompt 

it will have a hover effect where when you pass over the gird it will leabe a color. it will also trail like a pen would 

a button at the top of the screen will be the prompt to change the squares 

add a button that changes the color of the squares (gives a color wheel)


RECAP: 
I had a struggle with this one. Im happy I went back to learn though and gave it my best shot. I understand the code when I look at it its more about the syntax to actually achieve what I was hoping for.
